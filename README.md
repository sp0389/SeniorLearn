# Senior Learn

Senior Learn is an education platform designed to replace paper and Excel-based record keeping with a role-aware system for managing courses, lessons, enrolments, and subscriptions.
The platform is designed to be intutive and easy to use.

## Overview
- Administrators can register new users and assign roles.
- User roles: **Standard**, **Professional**, **Honorary**.
- Standard members can enrol in classes with an active subscription.
- Professional members have a 3â€‘month trial; they remain professional while teaching. Professional members can also enrol in courses and lessons, but not their own.
- Honorary members have lifelong membership; they hold the same authorisation as Professional members allowing them to create courses and lessons.
